The comma operator in JavaScript allows you to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement, returning the value of the last expression. It’s often used in loops or to include multiple expressions where only one is expected.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate its usage:
let x = 10;
let y = (x++, x + 5);

console.log(x); // Output: 11
console.log(y); // Output: 16
